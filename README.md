## HSQP Tokenization Pipeline

The figure below illustrates the **HSQP (Hierarchical Symbolic–Quantized Pipeline)** workflow, showing how raw time-series data is converted into token sequences suitable for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 🔍 Overview

**HSQP** is a **plug-and-play symbolic–quantized framework** designed to convert continuous time-series into **compact, semantically meaningful token sequences** suitable for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Unlike conventional discretization or neural-only tokenizers, HSQP integrates:

- **Symbolic aggregation** for temporal structure preservation  
- **Quantization** for numerical compactness  
- **Hierarchical tokenization** for scalable long-horizon forecasting  

HSQP can be seamlessly attached to existing forecasting architectures (PatchTST, TimeLLM, TimeCMA) and LLM-based pipelines without retraining the backbone model.

## ✨ Key Contributions

- A unified **symbolic–quantized tokenization pipeline** for time-series  
- Plug-and-play compatibility with **LLMs and transformer forecasters**  
- Strong performance across **forecasting, compression, and reconstruction**  
- Interpretable and low-entropy token sequences  
- Minimal overhead and modular design
